# Overview

Use Ansible and Vagrant to build a load balancer, behind which run two nginx applications which return hello world and the private ip address of the they belong to.

# Assumptions

- User is running vagrant on a linux based os
- User has curl installed
- User has nc installed

# Solution

Adopted a KISS approach ( keep it simple stupid ). The host box only has vagrant installed and therefore the ansible_local vagrant provisioner has been chosen.

This will install the latest version of Ansible on each host and run the playbook on the host machine.

In order to keep the solution simple no existing roles have been included, as most roles tend to do "too much" and don't solve this specific problem elegantly.
All ip addresses have been hardcoded everywhere. In real life use of the Ansible inventory file would be preferred as to remove the current duplication.

As this is a Vagrant box, presumably just for a test/training environment security has not been considered. There are no firewalls / backup scripts for the box.

If this were to be moved from a test environment to a production product it would be strongly recommended to secure this system further using iptables,ferm,fail2ban etc.

Testing the application will be via the shell provisioner. netcat is assumed to be installed on the host machine for these tests.

The applications for running the "hello world" test will be written in nodejs. Node will be installed as part of the playbook.yml.

GIT has been used to version control the scripts

Everything is installed under sudo which isn't best practice but has been done for speed.

# How to run

On a box with vagrant / curl and netcat installed

- tar -xvf automation-logic-test.tar.gz
- vagrant up



# Troubleshooting

Downloading the latest version of node failed due to the url using SNI ( Server Name Indication ). In order to access the URL python needed to be updated to 2.7.9. Installing python 2.7.10 fixes the problem. I used the PPA from Kelix Krull without much thought, there's a lot of warnings about it being supported. In real life I'd of probably compiled python manually, or better still used the latest LTS of Ubuntu

Ansible failed to complete when trying to test if pm2 was already running the hello world app on the first run of the script due to an import _unicode step missing. This worked on subsequent versions of ansible. I presume because the version of python installed by default on this box didn't include the _unicode library and the environment wasn't updated after installing the later version of the first run. As a quick fix I split the provisioner in the Vagrant file so that the second time it runs it'll pick up the new environment and run through the ansible correctly. This problem would be better solved by using the latest LTS of Ubuntu.

# Further work

Things that I deemed out of scope for this example but could be expanded in future

- Security, firewalls, locking down users etc
- Proper use of ansible using inventory files / group vars
	- This would also allow asynchronous creation of the machines
- Logging
- Server monitoring ( check_mk / nagios etc )
- Automated tests for the nodejs application
- Multiple nodejs applications over multiple cores with one nodejs balancer in front of them
- Improvements to the ansible for speed ( for example there's no need to keep running the node install script )
- Make the hello-world application more interesting


# Notes on test

- Considering using more recent box. The latest LTS release is 16.04 would be easier ( in terms of package management than the box defined in the test). Maybe the test could be changed to read "install the latest LTS support of ubutnu" rather than a specific box name.

- Making nginx idempotent

	- By using ansible apt module to install the nginx server is already created, this step is "idempotent by default as apt-get will not install nginx again once it's installed once"

- Editing the sudoers file

By default a file is placed in /etc/sudoers.d/ called 10_vagrant which sets the vagrant user up with no password. Maybe the test could be changed so a new user has to be created called "deploy" in order to better test this?

The admin group is also set to regain privileges. Maybe a better test would be to lock the system down first, and then only allow sudo privileges as created.

Because of this there are no extra steps in my playbook for performing these tasks.
